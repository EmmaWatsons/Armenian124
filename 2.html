      Kekel? What kind of name is that? Can you tell me more about yourself?
    </div> 
        <div class = "self">
      It means beautiful
    </div>
    <div class = "other">
      Beautiful? Ha! I'll be the judge of that. 
    </div> 
      <div class = "self">
      Oh I've dealt with men like you before...
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
      Men like me? What do you mean? Also why do you feel such that your heart has been broken so much already? Why engage in such folly? 
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
    Oh, you treat marriage like it's something that is life or death! Like you would die if you don't get married!
    </div> 
      <div class = "self">
      Is it not so? What worth does a woman have if she is not married? We are confined to the household, so yes, I would like to get married and live what little worth I have to live!
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
      How would you feel about marrying me?
    </div> 
      <div class = "self">
      What?
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
      Yes! I want to get married too! Sometimes it is not just the men who have all the power- the last girl I was talking to, she had her pick between six different suitors!
    </div> 
      <div class = "self">
      Aren't we moving too fast? It is all I want, but...
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
      Yes! That's exactly the thing I wanted to tell you Kekel, why are you so stressed about getting into a marriage? Marriage is not just something you just do like putting on a shoe! There is a lot to consider before getting married!
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
      It is something that requires a lot of thought before entering in, really, think about it- is marriage even a good thing? Should you even want it at all in the first place?
    </div> 
      <div class = "self">
      I know for you it is a hard decision because there are advantages and disadvantages to both being single and getting married, but you are A MAN. 
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
      Oh! Think about it Kekel! It is not just so because I am a man, to tie yourother down for life, for your whole life, just to finish like that. Is that really what you want? Is that really what you're spending your energy worrying over?
    </div> 
      <div class = "self">
      Hmm, maybe you do have a point...
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
      Marriage isn't so important, I would not recommend feeling so sad over it- do it only if you want to with the right person, not for the sake of marriage.
    </div> 
      <div class = "self">
      Yes okay, maybe it was a blessing in disguise. I thank you for the insight.
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
      Now then, do I want to get married? Oh, I don't know!
    </div> 
      <div class = "self">
      I'm so done with you. But I do thank you for opening my eyes to that view. Goodbye Podkolyosin.
