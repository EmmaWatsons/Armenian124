      Hello Arousiag, how are you?
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
      Hi
    </div>
    <div class = "self">
      Can I take you out?
    </div> 
    <div class = "other">
      We can be friends, but I don't see you in that way- my apologies. I mainly swiped right because I wanted you learn more about how you vindicated your family, I'd love to hear!
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
      Okay, so listen to this. I needed to pay a dowry for my poor sister. She is honestly such a good person, just very unfortunate and had her heart broken often. My poor Kekel!
    </div> 
        <div class = "self">
          Anyway, we didn't have enough money to pay for her dowry, but I knew this old crook Arutin owed us money, I just could not find the note with his signature that proved it, and being the snake he is, he pretended like he didn't know.
    </div> 
        <div class = "self">
          But then I found the note! The picture is me showing him the note, and I was able to prove how he cheated us and probably many more families. 
    </div> 
    <div class = "other">
        Wow, that's incredible. I honestly just want to hug and encourage Kekel- I've heard of dowries existing obviously, but no girl should have to be treated like that. Me personally, I get to do as I please, my husband loves me, and they actually had to ask my
        dad to let me move in with them! Since I come from a very wealthy background.
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
          My jaw is dropping. I have never even heard of a situation like you described before. I will let Kekel know and tell her to drop the fool who bailed on her.
    </div> 
    <div class = "other">
        Yes, no girl should have to settle for less. I want her to be happy! I want her to be able to find a man she can truly love and loves her back.
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
          What you just described just does not exist in my world or in my experience. Sometimes, we have no choice, as we are a poor working class family. What family would want a girl from such a background? 
    </div> 
        <div class = "self">
          Do you have any advice for how to move in that direction?
    </div> 
    <div class = "other">
      I do think it's harder to be like that if you're a girl coming from a poor family...do you know anyone in your life that married into a rich family?
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
          Well there is Epemia...
    </div> 
    <div class = "other">
        Ask her how she was able to live her lifestyle! 
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
          She's married to Arutin lol
    </div> 
    <div class = "other">
      Oh...that's awkward. But in general, I want you to encourage Kekel, but also understand the reality of the situation. I know men will see her less if they find out she was "divorced" or if her fiancee left her. 
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
          Yes, it takes time. But thank you for showing me this other path. Good bye Arousiag! Arshag is a lucky man.
    </div> 
    <div class = "other">
      Good bye Pepo!
