      Well aren't you quite the demander.

      A hello would be nice- my name's Epemia. And I know my profile makes it seem like I'm this awful, awful materialistic person but I'm really not- and I'm also hoping to kind of push an agenda for women, you feel?
    </div>
    <div class = "other">
      What kind of agenda are we talking about here?        
    </div> 
    <div class = "self">
      I think women in our society should have the right to pursue what interests us and live well!
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
        As a man, I totally agree on this. My wife Arousiag loves to sing and go on walks and dance, but my damn sister and mother are resenting her so much for this.
    </div> 
    <div class = "self">
        Oh, my condolences to you...I take your side here, I totally think Arousiag should be able to express her love of the arts.
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
          So what brought you into your situation?
    </div> 
    <div class = "self">
        I have the luxury of having been married to a rich man, and instead of doing housework and only staying inside, I have a lot of the power! I think more women should take my lead. Are you currently searching for someone though?
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
          I have eyes only for Arousiag- however, I am glad we see eye to eye on that issue. What advice would you have for Arousiag's situation as a woman? She actually was from a wealthy family originally.
    </div> 
    <div class = "self">
        As far as your mother and sister are concerned, they seem jealous. The key is that our society as a whole needs to push for this movement as women. Tell your mother and sister to embrace and celebrate it.
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
        I came from modest means and married into my current situation- it seems like yours is the other way around. However, it is good to have men like you as part of our movement.
    </div>
      <div class = "self">
        Actually, I had a situation last week where my husband had been lying about owing the money to a family who needed it as dowry money! I was ashamed, I tell you! Ashamed! You cannot put a price on these things, I was actually very against this entire concept.
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
          Yes yes of course, anything for Arousiag...so I will try my best to act more as a catalyst for this change. Thank you Epemia.
    </div> 
    <div class = "self">
          Thank you Arshag. Good bye!
