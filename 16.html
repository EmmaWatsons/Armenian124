    <div class = "self">
      Hello Kekel! You must be a beautiful girl, as your name suggests
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
      Clearly not enough...    
    </div>
    <div class = "self">
      Oh, what's wrong?
    </div> 
    <div class = "other">
      My fiancee left me because our family couldn't pay the dowry. If I was really that beautiful, would that have happened? Oh, do men have a conscience or a soul? I have had my heart broken so much recently. 
    </div>
      <div class = "self">
      Wow, is that situation commonplace for women in your life?   
    </div> 
    <div class = "other">
      Yes, sadly
    </div>
      <div class = "self">
       I am truly appalled to hear that- in my life, we actually had to convince the bride's family to let her live with us!     
    </div> 
    <div class = "other">
        What?!?!?!? I just want someone to love me and to love, us girls here are truly seen as a mere object of material value.
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
      That's really messed up, I truly send my sympathies to you. Know that you don't deserve this and that there are parts of this world, parts of this country even where women do not have to be treated that way. And you definitely seem like a girl
      who doesn't deserve to be treated that way. 
    </div> 
    <div class = "other">
      No, thank you for telling me, I'm glad I learned that there is still good in this world. Praise God. I do feel better now, knowing that men exist out there who can love enough to even ask MY mother for permission to join their family.
    </div>
      <div class = "self">
      Yes! Don't lose hope, I can possibly even help cover your dowry (although would you really want to be with a man who wouldn't marry you if your family couldn't cover the dowry)? 
    </div> 
    <div class = "other">
      Yes I have turned a new leaf with new hope for love. Speaking of which, are you single?
    </div>
          <div class = "self">
      Haha, unfortunately, I know we matched on Tinder but I am very in love with my bride Arousiag. She is an amazing woman, although my female direct family members are not treating her well. 
    </div> 
      <div class = "self">
      Also a woman's role should not be confined to just the household! You should pursue your passions! Your dreams! Go to the cinema if you want!
    </div> 
    <div class = "other">
      Oh okay no problem...well I hope everything gets figured out on your end- and thank you again for letting me know that there are other options for me. I truly feel rejuvinated now. Good bye Arshag!
    </div>
          <div class = "self">
      Good bye Kekel, best of luck, I will be praying for you!
