      You know I was unsure if I wanted to be married but then I saw you.
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
        Haha sorry, but my heart already belongs to someone else.
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
      On a serious note though, I honestly don't know if I want to get married.    
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
          Why are you even on tinder then?
    </div>
            <div class = "self">
        Well part of me still does, maybe I'll meet someone I like enough that will tip the scales for me. What are your thoughts on marriage? 
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
          Keep in mind I'm a female, but coming from my perspective, it's honestly not an easy process for us. I got pretty lucky, but with dowries and most women's inability to go beyond staying in the house, it's a struggle. Plus it can cause conflict within your family... 
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
          I know that all sounds very depressing, but there are benefits too! I think marriage as a whole can be used as a great tool to strengthen the position in women in our culture. It partly comes down to men like you though.
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
          I truly think part of the reason you're so unsure about marriage is because you're only thinking about yourself- if you were to consider the other person more, you would see the beauty in it.
    </div>
            <div class = "self">
          Yes, I now see the benefits, and how important it is for us to be agents of change. 
    </div> 
            <div class = "self">
              Thank you. I'm shook.
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
          You're welcome. Let me know if you ever get married!
    </div>
