        Hello Hanumig
    </div> 
        <div class = "self">
        What do you want?
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
          Wow, are you always this rude? I'm here the same reason you are- to find a partner!
    </div> 
        <div class = "self">
          Are you rich?
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
          Is that all you care about? I'm not the richest person, no...
    </div> 
        <div class = "self">
          I'm sorry, it's just that my damned sister-in-law has really warped my perception of marriage. No one ever considers how the rest of the family feels!
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
          What do you mean?
    </div> 
        <div class = "self">
          Ever since my brother got married, he's been spoiling his wife! While his mother and I do all the work around the house! 
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
          No one sees it, but there are levels to the problems females face, okay? As the bride, I get that you're not supposed to be excited about love and all that (however not of these rules seem to apply to Arousiag, which makes me even more angry)
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
          But no one ever sees how it affects the sisters or the mother! It's the next level! We are being treated even worse, how can we hope to progress the feminist agenda when this happens to us?
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
          Wow, I can totally relate to the part about marriage affecting the rest of the family- I nearly died trying to pay my sister's dowry. You also gave me something to think about if I ever get married though- to never let Kekel or my mother feel bad.
    </div> 
        <div class = "self">
          Yes, and it annoys me so much that Arousiag (my brother's wife) is able to just throw herself at others, and sing and dance and walk around at will AS A MARRIED WOMAN. 
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
          Is she happy though? This does seem strange to me as a woman's behavior as well, but I do care about Kekel being happy...
    </div> 
        <div class = "self">
          Yes she is happy, and your sister could do, if she's okay with living a shameful life.
    </div>
        <div class = "other">
          Hmm, I think I will let Kekel know actually that she has happiness ahead- but I do send my sympathies as a family member. I hope your situation gets figured out.
    </div> 
        <div class = "self">
          Yeah, whatever. I didn't expect you to understand. Blocked bye.
    </div>
