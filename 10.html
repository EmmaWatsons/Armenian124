      Hello Hanumig         
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
          You're too old for me
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
         You're really helpful in convincing me to marry someone then...
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
          Marry? Why on earth would you want to marry? Listen dude, marriage sucks. Don't do it. It's ruined my life, and I'm not even married.
    </div>
            <div class = "self">
         Why? I've been struggling a lot to commit to it lately, because I don't know if I wanted to be grounded down for so long, so I partially agree with you, I just usually never hear this from a woman.
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
          Oh, getting married is GREAT if you have a husband who will pamper you, but does anyone remember the family members? No, never. It ruins the lives of the people around you.
    </div>
            <div class = "self">
         I wouldn't want that!
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
          No? Then don't get married.
    </div>
            <div class = "self">
         What's up with you though? Why are you so bitter?
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
          I'M BITTER BECAUSE MY SISTER IN LAW GETS TO DO EVERYTHING SHE WANTS AND I HAVE TO DO ALL THE WORK.
    </div>
            <div class = "self">
         Why don't you drop all that then? Is it really your responsibility? Why not get married yourself? I feel like there are so many solutions to this.
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
          It's not that easy as a woman, we can't just get married tomorrow at will. 
    </div>
            <div class = "self">
         Ah yes, I should consider myself lucky in that sense then. I don't even know if I want to, but it's nice to have that luxury.
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
          Yes, so do you see how hard it is for me to get out my situation? That's why I'm unhappy.
    </div>
            <div class = "self">
         I understand. I'm truly sorry to hear that.
    </div>
