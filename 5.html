    <div class = "self">
        Hey you're pretty cute.
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
          Don't say that and then plan on leaving me.
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
          Trust me, after what happened to my sister, there's no way I would do that.
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
          Oh, what happened to your sister?
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
          First off, why is your occupation bride?
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
          Because I've been trying to get married forever, my matchmaker's put me through so many men, but they all either flake or I don't like them! Also I'm a bit indecisive. Now what happened to your sister?
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
          Honestly, you don't have it that bad. No one ever thinks about the men's side of the whole marriage issue- not just the groom, but the family. I've lost so many nights of sleep trying to pay for my sister's dowry.
    </div> 
        <div class = "self">
          What happened to my sister? Her fiancee left her. And I needed to come up with the dowry or he would leave her for good.
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
          Hmm, maybe Kekel doesn't have it that bad- at least she found someone! I can't seem to find anyone, woe is me.
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
          Oh shut up. You have your choice of multiple men, with a matchmaker. Do you even need to pay a dowry? In a sense, any girl would kill to be in your position, let alone the position of the family that needs to come up with the dowry!
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
          I'm sorry! I didn't mean any disrespect, you seem like an honorable, fit man. And I totally get that the men of the family also go through stress in the marriage process. 
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
          I would love for Kekel to be in your situation though, how do I approach that? 
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
          Look to get a matchmaker! I'm sure she can get Kekel someone!
    </div>
        <div class = "self">
          Okay, thanks for showing me this other option. I will try to help Kekel do that. Would you like to go out with me though?
    </div> 
        <div class = "other">
          Yes, you seem better than any of the monkeys I've had to deal with already. And sure.
    </div>
