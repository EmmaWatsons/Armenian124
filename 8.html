      Heya Agafya. Haha, get it?
    </div> 
        <div class = "self">
          I've heard that a million times already. Nice try though.
    </div>
      <div class = "other">
        :(
    </div> 
        <div class = "self">
          Why is it so hard to find love? I want a man who makes me feel decisive in wanting him. I want to be able to feel that way, and not have second thoughts. I have yet to meet anyone like that though.
    </div>
          <div class = "other">
            I'm sorry to hear that- I think I have found true love and I can tell you a little more about it. However, I do acknowledge the issues women in our society face in relation to romance. My own sister and mother are at my throat even because of my wife!
    </div> 
        <div class = "self">
          Oh please, what do you know?
    </div>
          <div class = "other">
            Well, I know that true love is sort of like what you just described- you don't get second thoughts, you don't feel conditionals. It's a very decisive feeling and it is shown in the actions of both individuals. On the other hand, I am aware of 
            the difficulties many girls face in not being able to express their emotions, in the dowries, in their role as staying in the house. I think it's all BS personally, but you should be grateful for your situation Agafya.
    </div> 
          <div class = "other">
            Did I miss anything?
    </div> 
        <div class = "self">
          Yes yes! That's all I want. I just want to feel that way about someone. I was not aware of how fortunate my situation truly was though, do you have any advice for how I can find that feeling?
    </div>
          <div class = "other">
            Well first off, realize that we should push to let more girls even have the choice to feel that way- but that being said, know what you want in a man beforehand- and base how he feels off his actions, not his words.
    </div> 
        <div class = "self">
          YES I GET IT. I'm doing better than the average girl. And thanks for the advice, I'll make sure I know what I want and have him prove it. Thanks Arshag!
    </div>
          <div class = "other">
            Good luck!
